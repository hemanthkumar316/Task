**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Design a social proof section while keeping it as close to the mockup as you can.
You can use any tool you like to complete the challenge.

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both, mobile and desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
There is also a `Front-end Style Guide` section that has information you may need such as color palettes and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
